# Person properties for DrD+

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jaroslavtyc/drd-plus-properties.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jaroslavtyc/drd-plus-properties)

All properties for DrD+ character from base as strength across derived as beauty to native as infravision.

Base and body properties are ready for persistence by Doctrine as an enum.

Derived properties are not designed to be persisted, but calculated always again and again from base and body ones.
